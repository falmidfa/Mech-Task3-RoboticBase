# Mech-Task3-RoboticBase

For my basic robot car design, I chose **PLA filament** because it is easy to print, cost-effective, and provides sufficient strength for lightweight applications. Since the robot will not operate under extreme conditions such as high temperatures or heavy mechanical stress, PLA is a suitable and efficient material choice. Additionally, it allows for smooth surface finishing and can be easily painted or modified if needed.
